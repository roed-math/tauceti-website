"""The published atlas grouped by arXiv subject: one galaxy for each arXiv mathematics category.

Every Tau Ceti roadmap declares its category in its metadata.toml (`topic = "math.NT"`): the Progress
page passes it on for the roadmaps Tau Ceti has accepted, and a pull request's own metadata.toml gives
a proposed roadmap's. A roadmap that declares none takes the category of the nearest folder above it
that declares one; else of most of the roadmaps it is linked to (its prerequisites, the roadmaps that
use it and those its README names), when they clearly agree; else of the subject its title or README
names (data/tauceti-arxiv-areas.json, read backwards); else it waits in a galaxy of its own, "No arXiv
category", until its metadata.toml declares one.

The categories go round Mathlib in a fixed order, so that related subjects are neighbours (number
theory between representation theory and algebraic geometry, analysis beside PDE and probability).
Each galaxy is a contiguous sector of the circle (`sector`, in degrees), a share that grows with its
roadmaps, and the map lays each roadmap out in its sector as far from Mathlib as its distance
(src/universe.js). The largest categories are divided into finer areas (data/arxiv-subareas.json):
each area is then a galaxy, a sector within its category's, and the category is the field that
names them together.
