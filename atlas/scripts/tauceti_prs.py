"""Roadmaps proposed to Tau Ceti: each roadmap an open pull request to TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap adds.

The atlas shows Tau Ceti's roadmaps (scripts/tauceti_progress.py) and, beside them, every roadmap an
open pull request adds, whoever opened it. Each is read from the README on the pull request's branch,
as a roadmap the Progress page lists without layers is: its layers from its headings, its area from
its arXiv category (metadata.toml) and the roadmaps it names. A pull request that only edits a roadmap
already on main adds nothing here; the edit shows once it merges. Where two pull requests add the same
roadmap, the one updated last is shown.

This module keeps a copy (data/tauceti-prs.json): the pull requests, with the commit each points to, and
for each roadmap they add its arXiv category. The READMEs themselves are large (57 MB on 2026-10-21) and
change with every push, so they stay out of the repository, in a cache keyed by that commit
(data/tauceti-prs-readmes.json), and the page carries each roadmap's layers but reads its README from
GitHub when it is opened. A build fails rather than drop proposals whose READMEs are not cached.

A pull request opened with Tau Ceti's roadmap tooling states its prerequisites in its description, in a
merge-order block: every open pull request that must merge before it, and which of those add roadmaps its
README cites. The copy keeps both (`stated`), and the atlas holds the README's prerequisites to them
(scripts/roadmap_dependencies.py, follow_pull_requests).

Usage: tauceti_prs.py --fetch   list the open pull requests (with gh) and download their roadmaps
