"""Each roadmap's distance from Mathlib on the published pages, by the roadmaps it rests on.

A roadmap rests on every roadmap it builds on, and on everything those rest on in turn: its prerequisite
closure, over the prerequisites the READMEs name (scripts/roadmap_dependencies.py) and those the snapshot
declares. Its distance is the work still to do there, counted in roadmaps: each roadmap of the closure, itself
included, counts the share of its layers not yet done (half for a layer in progress), so a finished roadmap
counts nothing and a proposed one counts in full. The distances are placed on a 0-10 scale in proportion,
10 being the farthest roadmap on the page, so a roadmap resting on twice the work lies twice as far out.

The READMEs say some dependencies both ways: two roadmaps each naming the other, or a longer cycle. A
dependency is said more surely by its dependent's README than by its supplier's, in a dependency section than
in a sentence, by several READMEs than by one (each edge's `weight`); a link the snapshot declares is sure, and
one a pull request's description states (kind "pull") surer than anything the READMEs say against it.
Of two roadmaps naming each other, the direction said clearly more surely stays and an even pair goes; any
cycle left loses its least sure link. The links set aside stay on the map; only the distances leave them out.
