# research/blueprint/ the build reads (about 530 MB) stay in cbirkbeck/tauceti-explorer, where the
# research pipeline maintains them. This checks them out sparsely into WORK/, lays atlas/'s code
# over them (scripts find the data relative to themselves), refreshes the Tau Ceti progress and
# open-PR snapshots the way the Atlas's scheduled job did, and builds.
